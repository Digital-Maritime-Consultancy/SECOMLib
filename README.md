# SECOMLib
A Java library facilitating the development of SECOM-compliant web interfaces

## Development Setup
To start developing just open the repository with the IDE of your choice. The
original code has been generated using
[Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea). Just open it by going to:

    File -> New -> Project From Verson Control

Provide the URL of the current repository and the local directory you want.

You don't have to use it if you have another preference. Just make sure you
update the *.gitignore* file appropriately.

## Description
A SECOM-compliant service endpoints is quite standardised so a simple library
with the required data structures and endpoint definitions should be very handy
while developing these type of services. The version of the library should
follow the implemented version of the SECOM standard to keep things tidy.
